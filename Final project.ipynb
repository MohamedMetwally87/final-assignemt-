    "Mobile service demand is growing exponentially, the quality of service expected by the customers is getting higher, as the social media need is increasing. Mobile network planning and tower location selection is a very critical task to perform nowadays, as the location selection will affect the customer quality of service. After the network is growing and the customers increase, the solution and location selected need to be very specific in order to deliver the needed service with customer satisfaction. a big problem appeared in the mobile operators that the wrong decision in solution and tower location selection will lead to wrong investment and waste of resources with out delivering the quality of service needed affecting the return on investment. \n",
